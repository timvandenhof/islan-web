## Images
Images need to be copy right free, fair use and/or officially allowed (for example, from a presskit).  
Image thumbnails are created with [Paint.NET](https://getpaint.net/).  
It is recommended to compress images in the website source folder, to reduce bandwith. For example with the [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) tool.
